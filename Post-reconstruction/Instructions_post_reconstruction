1. Passport.sh  
   To run passport on multiple root files use the passport.sh
   Inside the passport.sh, add the run numbers.
   This saves the file with the QR code  
  
2. merge_csv_file.py  
   Use this to merge all the CSV files produced by the passport.sh.  
   To do that first copy all the csv files to a folder, copy merge_csv_file.py to the same folder.  
   After running this script it will produce a single csv file with all the data for each run and quadrant.  
   In the end, you can plot the data from the CSV file. It will contain a run number, channel, SNR, DCR, DiCT, 1 pe amplitude, etc
